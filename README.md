# Master-Thesis

The repository shows all used scripts in applied during my studies for my master thesis "Identification of a Novel Enzyme in the NADHX Repair System in Saccharomyces cerevisiae".
BCA_Assay_Evalution is used for quantification of protein concentrations throughout the isolated crude extracts and fractions.
End-Point Enzymatic Assay Analysis is used for analysis of obtained peak areas corresponding to the product and substrate in order to investigated the analysis of the enzyme of interest throughout different purification batches.
Specific Activity Analysis is used to quantify the catalysis in terms of production, by quantifying the production by generating a linear regression of product to calculate the produced amount by peak areas.
